<h1>libinjection SQLi False Positives</h1>

<p>Due to the nature of SQL and how databases, some very benign looking
queries are sometimes flagged as SQLi.  As an example:</p>

<pre><code>I &#39;LIKE&#39; YOU
</code></pre>

<p>While it looks benign, actually it will execute as a SQLi and can be
used to scan the contents of a table (the <code>LIKE</code> operator with two
strings).</p>

<p>Fortunately, most false-positives like this are limited to a few
fingerprints and can be turned off with out effecting detection of
other SQLi attacks.</p>
